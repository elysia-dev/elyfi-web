        "What is ELYFI?",
        "ELYFI is a real world asset-backed lending DeFi. ELYFI users can borrow cryptocurrency using their real world assets as collateral. The cryptocurrency used for the loan comes from another group of users of ELYFI, the cryptocurrency depositors. They deposit their own tokens or coins in ELYFI for the purpose of deposit interest. Users who want to get a loan borrow cryptocurrency from the money pool formed in this way, and pay the principal and interest to ELYFI on repayment.",

        "A decentralized financial system that is not controlled by a central entity and operates according to a DAO or system.

      ],
      "question_second": [
        "Why ELYFI?",
        "ELYFI is the only DeFi that offers both attractive financial products and stability. Existing DeFi is a structure that lends only cryptocurrency as collateral. Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, there are limitations in providing stable collateral value and liquidity. In fact, in the case of A DeFi, which boasted a high yield of 20% per year, it could not afford the interest rate.",
        "ELYFI minimized loan risk through real world asset collateral. Since real estate or real estate-related bonds are used as collateral, even if the borrower does not repay, the loan can be financed with real world assets held as collateral. Also, from the borrower's point of view, the incentive to repay is greater because they want to maintain their ownership to the real world assets they own. In fact, the NPL ratio has been 0% since the launch of ELYFI."

Tokenization here refers to the process of making real world assets into tokens so that they can be used on the blockchain.",

          "ELYFI is a DeFi project by the Elysia team, a decentralized project that connects the real world asset and the cryptocurrency market. With ELYFI, you can conduct various financial activities with crypto. You can get a loan from ELYFI using the asset token (reflecting real asset value) created through the Elysia protocol as a collateral. In addition, users can earn money by depositing their own cryptocurrency into the money pool or purchasing NFT products.",
          "Bond NFT is the right to receive repayment (principal and interest income) on the maturity date of the bond. By selling bond NFTs through ELYFI, borrowers receive a cryptocurrency loan with the raised amount, and NFT owners can receive the principal and interest repaid by the borrower on the maturity date of the bond.",
          "This product does not guarantee principal and profits under the current laws. More specifically, it is prohibited to compensate investment of customers’ losses in advance or afterward according to the local regulation of the Republic of Korea. However, ELYFI minimizes investment risks through collateral setting, a thorough examination of investment products, and various investor protections.",
          "There is no limit to the amount of investment in this product. For this reason, by investing a large amount of money, you, also, can expect high returns.",
          "One bond NFT price is $10.",
          "You cannot cancel the purchase of this product. However, you can trade bond NFTs held by OpenSea, an NFT marketplace. In addition, the right to receive reimbursement (principal and interest income) from the sale of the NFT is delegated to the NFT buyer.\n※ NFT sales do not imply a guarantee of principal.",
          "This product can be purchased with cryptocurrency (ETH, USDC). For specific purchase methods, please refer to this guide as it has been explained in detail in the purchasing guide.",
          "There is no ELYFI platform fee for this product. However, ELYFI users will use the Ethereum network when purchasing NFTs or receiving repayments, and accordingly, users must pay the Ethereum network usage fee (gas fee) in Ether (ETH). The gas fee is received from the Ethereum network, not from ELYFI.",
          "The repayment of this product (principal and interest income) can be directly received in USDC tokens on the ELYFI site on the maturity date of the bond. However, it may be replaced with other tokens depending on the situation. In addition, depending on the borrower's financial situation, repayment may be made early before the maturity date, and repayment may be received from the time of repayment.",
          "In case of delinquency, the interest rate for overdue payment of 15% is charged from the day after the bond maturity date by adding up the interest rate for delinquency (3%). In addition, if the bond is not repaid within 60 days from the day after the maturity date, the NFT of this bond is collected by selling it to another institution with the goal of recovering the full principal and interest.",
          "If the loan is not executed, the purchase principal can be directly received in USDC, and USDC can be replaced with other coins depending on the circumstances."
