  why 4320?
  This value is the vertical value of UHD, which is the maximum resolution of an 8K monitor.
  The screen to which this value is applied has a fixed height of 100% anyway, 
  so it doesn't matter if the constant value is higher, 
  but first, we took the vertical value of the currently highest monitor resolution as a standard.
